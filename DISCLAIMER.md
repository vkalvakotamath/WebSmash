And if you know me, you probably realized that I *cough* was probably the one to realise that this could be applied to dating websites. To be clear: I have no interest in such things and being autistically hyperfixated on cats, my original intention was purely for cat pictures ranking (turns out I love Ragdolls more than Scottish Folds, huh...). But once this use case popped up, I realised that I could use the same elo-ranking algorithm as FaceMash (hebnce the near-portmanteau nature of the repository name) and let people rank pictures of people they were already viewing from their login sessions and judge purely on looks, and finally see info about the "best-fit". Of course, it can be used for anything and since I don't think there is a common HTML layout you will have to do a load of modifications to get it to do anything.

If indeed you are so autistic that you are willing to modify this script instead of getting tf out and actually meeting people, then you are my target audience and feel free to play around with the script to optimize the experience. However, review the policy of the target website and make sure that your requests aren't going to spam the server and cause an IP ban. I suggest you use this script for what it is: a fun comparator that makes getting info easier. 

And in this case it seems to be a reasonable and in fact the best-fit use-case since it makes the whole "swipe left", "swipe-right", "lol-you're-a-lonely-bozo" experience compressed into your hands where you can input the search query and basically get profiles and pictures. Once you correct the HTML targets to the right containers, you should be able to run the script and get pictures into the \Profiles folder and it should create sub-directories within it with a .txt and a .png/.jpg. If it doesn't work, feel free to troubleshoot or open an issue if you deem it necessary.



In case you simply want to get started with using it, there is a sample ranking scenario with a load of cat pictures and breeds. So go ahead and find out which cats are the best.
